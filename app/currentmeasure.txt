Current measurements between processors

 - Connected to AHT20 using I2C
 - Sampling AHT20 every 5 seconds
 - AHT20 power is not measured (supplied by different 3v3 with common GND)
 - Using INA3221 for current measurement
 - Let current stabilize for > 1 minute
 - Collect avg current after stabilization

 ESP32C6  - 17.60 mA, 90.53 mW
 ESP32S3  - 31.60 mA, 160.0 mW
 NRF52840 - 3.280 mA, 16.45 mW
 NRF54L15 - 1.600 mA, 8.230 mW
