# Zephyr Multi-Platform Test

This repository is based on the existing Zephyr Example Application, with specific tailoring to incorporate the processors I plan to use. This test will help aid me in my development of other applications with the goal of simple multi-platform development.

## Supported Boards

Currently, the platform supports the following:

* Seeed Studio:
  *  Xiao Esp32s3
  *  Xiao Esp32c6
  *  Xiao RP2040
  *  Xiao nRF52840
  *  Xiao nRF54L15

More boards will become available for testing as my collection grows. Next in line will be some RAK devices.
